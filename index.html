            <h1>Studying the Biography of the Prophet (PBUH): The Fourth Session</h1>
            <h2>The State of the World Before the Muhammadan Mission (An Extensive and Detailed Explanation)</h2>

            <h3>Expanded and Detailed Introduction</h3>
            <p>All praise is due to Allah Who created and proportioned, Who destined and guided, Who brought forth the pasture, and then made it dark stubble. All praise is due to Allah Who sent His messengers with clear proofs and guidance, to bring people out of darkness into light by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy. All praise is due to Allah Who sealed the messages with the message of His beloved and chosen one, our Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم - Peace and blessings be upon him), a comprehensive and conclusive message, suitable for every time and place, guiding all of humanity to what brings صلاح (righteousness) and فلاح (success) in this world and the Hereafter. We send our prayers and peace upon this noble Prophet, his pure family, his excellent companions, and those who follow them in excellence until the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Dear respected brothers and sisters, we continue our blessed journey in the realm of the Seerah (biography) of the Chosen One (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), a biography that is an inexhaustible source of wisdom and lessons, and a light by which we illuminate the paths of our lives. In this fourth session, we pause for reflection and contemplation before a decisive stage in human history, a stage that preceded the dawn of the Muhammadan prophethood. We will explore together the conditions of the world in that era, to realize the extent of the darkness that enveloped the corners of the earth, and the urgent need for the light of revelation to dispel these darknesses.</p>
            <p>Understanding the historical, social, and religious context that preceded the mission of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) is not merely an intellectual luxury or a display of information. Rather, it is a methodological necessity for understanding the depth of the Muhammadan message and realizing the magnitude of the change it brought about in people's lives. Just as a doctor does not diagnose a disease except after a careful examination of the patient, likewise, we cannot appreciate the value of the divine cure that Islam brought except after we become acquainted with the diseases that were ravaging human societies at that time.</p>
            <p>In our previous session, dear loved ones, we delved into the lineage of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), that noble lineage which is like a good tree, whose root is firm and its branches are in the sky. We explained how this lineage was not just a series of names, but reflected a prestigious social status, and clarified for us the complex map of tribal relations that governed Meccan and Arab society in general. Knowing these minute details, such as the Prophet's (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) belonging to Banu Hashim (بنو هاشم), the relationship of Banu Hashim with the rest of the clans of Quraysh (قريش), and the relationship of Quraysh with other Arab tribes, all contribute to our understanding of many of the events and situations that accompanied the Islamic call. For example, when we talk about Abu Talib's (أبو طالب) protection of the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), we realize that this protection was not merely an avuncular affection, but was also based on tribal customs that obligated the chief of the tribe to protect the members of his clan. When we reflect on the conflict that took place between the Muslims and Quraysh (قريش), we find that tribal affiliations played an important role in determining the loyalties of individuals and groups. The same applies when we study the events that followed the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), such as the issue of the Caliphate and the conflicts that arose among the Companions; understanding the tribal structure helps us to analyze these events more deeply and objectively.</p>

            <h3>Transition to Today's Topic: The World on the Cusp of Transformation</h3>
            <p>After shedding light on the lineage of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) and his status among his people, we move today, by the permission and guidance of Allah, to a panoramic exploration of the state of the world just before the moment Allah Almighty chose to send His final Prophet and Messenger. We will try to paint a comprehensive picture of the religious, moral, social, and economic reality that humanity was living in during that period, with a special focus on the Arabian Peninsula, as it is the land that Allah chose to be the cradle of the last heavenly messages. This review is not merely aimed at enumerating a list of vices and shortcomings. Rather, it is an attempt to understand the divine wisdom in choosing this time and place for the mission of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), and to realize the magnitude of the challenges faced by the Islamic call in its beginnings, and the greatness manifested in Islam's ability to bring about this radical transformation in people's lives.</p>

            <h4>Key Concept: The Pre-Islamic World</h4>
            <p>This session explores the global conditions—religious, moral, social, and economic—especially in Arabia, before Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) mission, highlighting the need for divine guidance.</p>
        </div>

        <section id="s2-quranic-prophetic-depiction" class="content-section">
            <h3>Quranic and Prophetic Depiction of the World Before Islam</h3>
            <p>The Quran and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) have depicted the state of the world before Islam in eloquent and impactful ways. Allah the Almighty says in His decisive Book, describing the state of the Arabs in particular:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided." (Quran, Al 'Imran آل عمران: 103)</blockquote>
            <p>This noble verse depicts how they were on the brink of an abyss, about to fall into the fire of misery and destruction, had not the mercy of Allah reached them with the mission of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH).</p>
            <p>As for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), he summarized this bitter reality for us in his noble Hadith, narrated by Imam Muslim from 'Iyad ibn Himar al-Mujashi'i (عيَاض بن حِمَار المُجَاشِعِي - May Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) said one day in his sermon:</p>
            <blockquote class="hadith-text">"Behold, my Lord commanded me to teach you what you were ignorant of, from what He taught me this day of mine... (until he said) And indeed, Allah looked at the people of the earth and despised them (مَقَتَهُمْ - maqatahum), their Arabs and their non-Arabs, except for remnants of the People of the Book..."</blockquote>
            <p>"Al-Maqt" (المقت) means the most severe hatred and wrath. This Hadith indicates that the anger of Allah Almighty had encompassed most of the people of the earth, their Arabs and their non-Arabs, due to their state of polytheism (الشرك - ash-Shirk), corruption, and deviation. Only a very few of the People of the Book were saved from this wrath, those who still adhered to remnants of the monotheistic religion (دين التوحيد - din at-Tawhid) brought by their prophets, even though their religion had also been subjected to much distortion and alteration.</p>
            <p>Humanity, O brothers, was living in one of the darkest periods of its history. Noble human values had vanished or were on the verge of vanishing, and injustice, ignorance, and corruption had spread everywhere. There was no voice of truth to be heard, nor a beacon of guidance to be followed. The previous heavenly religions had been subjected to distortion and corruption, and had lost much of their original essence. Christianity, which Jesus (عيسى - 'Isa, peace be upon him) brought as a message of love, peace, and monotheism, had deviated from its course, and doctrines of the Trinity, worship of saints and images, had entered it, and it had moved away from the simplicity of monotheism to which Christ had called. Judaism, which Allah revealed to Moses (موسى - Musa, peace be upon him) as a law and guidance, had turned into a closed, racial religion, and its scholars and rabbis had distorted the words of Allah, and sold them for a paltry price. As for the rest of the nations, they had drowned in the mires of paganism, worshipping idols, planets, animals, and even humans.</p>
            <p>Humanity yearned for a savior and looked forward to a light that would dispel this oppressive darkness. The human فطرة (<span class="arabic-term">fitrah</span> - innate disposition), which Allah created upon monotheism, was suffering under the weight of this polytheism and misguidance. Thus, the mission of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) was a response to this urgent need, and a mercy from Allah to the worlds.</p>

            <h3>The Conditions of the Arabs Before Islam: Detail and Expansion</h3>
            <p>Now, let us delve into the details of the conditions of the Arabs before Islam, to paint a clearer picture of the society that witnessed the dawn of prophethood.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="s3-1-economic-aspect" class="content-section">
            <h4>First: The Economic Aspect and Prevailing Livelihoods (Detail and Analysis)</h4>
            <p>Economic life in the Arabian Peninsula, that vast land whose topography varies between arid deserts, towering mountains, and green oases, was characterized by diversity and contrast, but overall, it was a simple life, dependent on limited natural resources, and greatly affected by harsh climatic conditions.</p>
            <h5>Desert Dwellers and the Life of Pastoralism and Nomadism (The Dominant Lifestyle)</h5>
            <p>Bedouin pastoralists constituted the vast majority of the population of the Arabian Peninsula. Their lives revolved around herds of camels, sheep, and goats, which were their primary source of livelihood. Theirs was not a life of stability, but one of constant wandering, moving from place to place in search of "الربع" (<span class="arabic-term">ar-Raba'</span> - areas of pasture and water) for their livestock. This lifestyle imposed upon them a certain harshness and toughness of character, and the ability to endure hardships and difficulties. They lived in simple tents made of goat hair or camel-hair, which were easy to transport, dismantle, and set up. Their food depended heavily on the milk and meat of their livestock, in addition to dates obtained from oases, and some wild plants that grew in the desert. They did not have organized agriculture, except in some scattered oases, nor did they have advanced industries; their industries were simple handicrafts to meet their daily needs, such as making tents, leather goods, and some simple weapons.</p>
            <p>Trade among them was limited, confined to the exchange of some basic goods. This lifestyle, although it endowed them with some positive qualities such as courage, generosity, and patience, also made them live in a state of relative poverty and lack of many of the components of civilization and material progress. Their lives were subject to the vagaries of nature, such as drought and famine, and raids by other tribes.</p>
            <h5>Urban Centers and Trading Hubs: Mecca (مكة المكرمة) as an Economic and Religious Center (Case Study)</h5>
            <p>In contrast to the Bedouin life of nomadism, some cities and urban centers in the Arabian Peninsula witnessed a degree of stability and economic prosperity. The most prominent of these cities, undoubtedly, was Mecca (مكة المكرمة - Makkah al-Mukarramah). Mecca gained its economic importance from several factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategic Location:</strong> Mecca was located at the crossroads of ancient trade routes, connecting the south of the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen - اليمن and Abyssinia - الحبشة) with its north (the Levant - بلاد الشام, Persia - فارس, and Egypt - مصر). This location made it an important station for trade caravans and a transit point for various goods and commodities.</li>
                <li><strong>Religious Status (The Biggest Attraction):</strong> Mecca housed the Kaaba (الكعبة المشرفة - al-Ka'bah al-Musharrafah), the Sacred House of Allah, built by Abraham (إبراهيم - Ibrahim) and Ishmael (إسماعيل - Isma'il, peace be upon them). Despite the spread of paganism and idol worship, the Arabs still venerated the Kaaba and performed Hajj (pilgrimage) to it from various parts of the Peninsula. This annual religious influx represented an important commercial season for the people of Mecca, where they would set up markets, and buy and sell with the pilgrims and those performing 'Umrah (عمرة - lesser pilgrimage).</li>
                <li><strong>Organization of Trade (The Role of Banu Hashim - بنو هاشم):</strong> Some prominent figures from Quraysh (قريش) played an important role in organizing and expanding trade. Among the most prominent of these was Hashim ibn Abd Manaf (هاشم بن عبد مناف), the grandfather of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH). Hashim was a man of insight and wisdom. He was the one who established the "الإيلاف" (<span class="arabic-term">al-Ilaf</span>) for Quraysh, which involved concluding commercial treaties and pacts with tribes and kings of neighboring regions (like the Levant, Yemen, Abyssinia, and Persia) to secure the trade routes for Quraysh's caravans. He also organized the two famous trade journeys: the winter journey (رحلة الشتاء - <span class="arabic-term">rihlat ash-shita'</span>) which headed south to Yemen and Abyssinia, laden with goods brought from the Levant and Persia, and the summer journey (رحلة الصيف - <span class="arabic-term">rihlat as-saif</span>) which headed north to the Levant, laden with products from Yemen and India. The Quran refers to these two journeys in Surah Quraysh (سورة قريش), reminding Quraysh of this great blessing:
                    <blockquote class="quran-verse">"For the accustomed security of Quraysh – Their accustomed security [in] the caravan of winter and summer – Let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear." (Quran, Quraysh قريش: 1-4)</blockquote>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These factors combined made Mecca a prosperous economic center and gave Quraysh (قريش) a prestigious position among the Arab tribes. They enjoyed security and stability in their sanctuary, while the rest of the regions lived in a state of chaos and turmoil. The Quran pointed to this blessing, saying:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"Have they not seen that We made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, while people are being snatched away all around them? Then do they believe in falsehood and deny the favor of Allah?" (Quran, Al-'Ankabut العنكبوت: 67)</blockquote>
            <h5>Yemen (اليمن) and its Vanished Agricultural Civilization (Reasons for Decline)</h5>
            <p>Yemen (اليمن), located in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, had a rich civilizational history and was known in ancient times as "Arabia Felix" (العربية السعيدة) for its fertile land, abundant water, and flourishing agriculture. The great Ma'rib Dam (سد مأرب - Sadd Ma'rib), considered one of the wonders of ancient engineering, played a vital role in irrigating vast areas of agricultural land, contributing to the establishment of an advanced and prosperous agricultural civilization. However, this prosperity did not last. The Ma'rib Dam (سد مأرب) suffered cracks and gradual collapse due to neglect, internal conflicts, and possibly other natural factors. This deterioration culminated in the "Flood of the 'Arim" (سيل العرم - <span class="arabic-term">Sayl al-'Arim</span>), a massive flood that destroyed the dam, inundated agricultural lands, and led to significant economic and social decline in Yemen. The Quran narrates this incident in Surah Saba' (سورة سبأ) as a lesson and admonition for those who would take heed:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"There was for [the tribe of] Saba' in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], 'Eat from the provision of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord.' But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees. That We recompensed them for what they denied, and do We recompense except the ungrateful?" (Quran, Saba' سبأ: 15-17)</blockquote>
            <p>This catastrophic event led to the dispersal of the people of Yemen to various parts of the Arabian Peninsula and beyond, and the migration of many Yemeni tribes northward, weakening Yemen's economic and political strength.</p>
            <h5>Yathrib (يثرب - Medina المنورة) as an Agricultural Oasis (The Role of the Ansar - الأنصار)</h5>
            <p>Yathrib (يثرب), which later became the first capital of the Islamic state and Medina (المدينة المنورة - al-Madinah al-Munawwarah), was located in a fertile area north of Mecca. It was famous for its abundant water and fertile soil, making it an important agricultural oasis. Its people, especially the tribes of Aws (الأوس) and Khazraj (الخزرج) (later known as the Ansar - الأنصار), relied heavily on agriculture, particularly date palm cultivation, which was an important source of food and income. They also grew some grains and vegetables. The Ansar (الأنصار) were known for their skill in agriculture and were people of hard work and diligence.</p>
            <h5>Summary of the General Economic Situation</h5>
            <p>In general, it can be said that economic life in the Arabian Peninsula before Islam was characterized by stark contrasts. While some areas, such as Mecca (مكة), Yathrib (يثرب), and Yemen (اليمن) (in its prosperous eras), enjoyed a degree of stability and relative prosperity, the vast majority of the population, especially in the deserts, lived a harsh and difficult life, dependent on limited resources, and greatly affected by the fluctuations of nature. There was no unified currency; trade was conducted through barter or by using foreign currencies like the Persian Dirham (الدرهم الفارسي) and the Roman Dinar (الدينار الروماني). There were no developed financial or economic institutions. This fragile economic situation had its repercussions on social and moral life, as we shall see.</p>

            <h4>Recap: Economic Landscape</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bedouins:</strong> Pastoral nomadism, harsh life, limited trade.</li>
                <li><strong>Mecca:</strong> Trade hub (Ilaf, winter/summer caravans), religious center (Kaaba).</li>
                <li><strong>Yemen:</strong> Past agricultural glory (Ma'rib Dam), decline due to dam collapse.</li>
                <li><strong>Yathrib (Medina):</strong> Agricultural oasis (dates, grains), home to Aws & Khazraj.</li>
                <li><strong>Overall:</strong> Contrasting conditions, resource scarcity, lack of unified economy.</li>

        <section id="s3-2-social-moral-aspect" class="content-section">
            <h4>Second: The Social and Moral Aspect: A Mosaic of Contradictions (Detailed and In-depth Analysis)</h4>
            <p>The social and moral fabric in the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula was a complex mosaic, where the dark colors of vices and deviations intertwined with some bright glimmers of noble values and ethical virtues. Social life did not follow a single pattern but was influenced by many factors, such as the geographical environment, tribal structure, religious beliefs, and inherited customs and traditions.</p>
            <h5>The Most Prominent Social and Moral Vices that Were Rampant (Critical Analysis)</h5>
            <p>The Jahiliyyah (الجاهلية - pre-Islamic) society suffered from many social and moral diseases that led to its deterioration and decline. Among the most prominent of these vices were:</p>
            <h6>Spread of Prohibitions and the Trade of Vice (Reflection of a Spiritual Crisis)</h6>
            <p>Prohibitions were not just isolated individual practices but were often part of the prevailing culture. Wine (الخمر - <span class="arabic-term">al-Khamr</span>) was drunk in their gatherings, they boasted about it, and held festivals for it. Much mention of wine and its gatherings is found in their poetry. The wine trade was thriving, and there were no restrictions to prevent it. Allah Almighty said, describing Islam's view of wine and gambling:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful." (Quran, Al-Ma'idah المائدة: 90)</blockquote>
            <p>Gambling (الميسر - <span class="arabic-term">al-Maysir</span>) was also a common practice. They would gamble on everything, sometimes even on themselves and their families. They saw it as a kind of generosity and munificence, as the winner in gambling would distribute his winnings to the poor and needy. However, Islam forbade gambling because it involved unjustly consuming people's wealth and led to enmity and hatred. Prostitution existed in various forms and was not condemned in all circles to the same degree. This reflects the extent of moral degradation the society had reached.</p>
            <h6>The Issue of Rebuilding the Kaaba and Illicit Money (Deep Implications)</h6>
            <p>The story of rebuilding the Kaaba (الكعبة), which we mentioned earlier, carries deep implications about the moral consciousness of Quraysh (قريش). Despite their veneration for the Kaaba, they were aware that much of their wealth was acquired through illicit means. This indicates a kind of duality in their moral standards. They venerated sacred things but, at the same time, did not hesitate to earn unlawful money. When they stipulated that only "طيب" (<span class="arabic-term">tayyib</span> - pure/good) money should be used in building the Kaaba, this condition in itself reflects an implicit admission of the existence of "خبيث" (<span class="arabic-term">khabeeth</span> - impure/evil) money in their possessions. When the pure money was insufficient to complete the building on the foundations of Abraham (إبراهيم), this reveals the extent of illicit money circulating among them. This incident, while indicating remnants of religious scruples, also exposes the pervasiveness of financial corruption in their lives.</p>
            <h6>Adultery (الزنا - az-Zina) and its Various Forms (Collapse of Family Values)</h6>
            <p>Adultery, in its various forms, represented a serious threat to family and social values. Books of Seerah (السيرة) and historical accounts mention several types of Nikah (النكاح - marriage) that were prevalent in Jahiliyyah (الجاهلية), which can only be described as forms of institutionalized or concealed adultery.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taking Akhdan (الأخدان - Secret and Forbidden Relationships):</strong> This type of relationship was common, where a man would take a woman as his secret lover (خليلة - <span class="arabic-term">khaleelah</span>), or a woman would take a man as her secret lover, without a legitimate marriage contract. These relationships were often conducted in secret, but were sometimes known. Islam forbade this type of relationship and considered it explicit adultery.</li>
                <li><strong>Nikah al-Istibda' (نكاح الاستبضاع - Seeking Offspring from Someone Other Than the Husband to Improve Lineage):</strong> This was one of the strangest and most heinous types of pre-Islamic "marriage." If a man wanted to have a child with certain qualities (like courage, generosity, or eloquence) that he did not find in himself, he would ask his wife to go to another man known for these qualities and ask him to have intercourse with her. If she conceived from him, her husband would stay away from her until she delivered, and then the child would be attributed to him. This type of "marriage" reflects a demeaning view of women, considering them mere vessels for procreation, and also reflects ignorance of the laws of heredity and a disregard for honor and chastity.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Prostitution (Nikah ar-Rayat - نكاح الرايات, and Brothels):</strong> Some women, especially slave girls or those without tribal protection, practiced prostitution openly. They would plant red flags (رايات - <span class="arabic-term">rayat</span>) at their doors as a sign by which their houses were known. Men would come to them from all directions and satisfy their desires for a known fee. This indicates the extent of moral degradation the society had reached, where prostitution became a declared profession in some places.</li>
                <li><strong>Nikah ar-Raht (نكاح الرهط - A Group Sharing One Woman):</strong> This was another type of pre-Islamic "marriage" where a group (رهط - <span class="arabic-term">raht</span>) of men, not exceeding ten, would all have intercourse with one woman. If she conceived and gave birth, she would send for all of them, and none could refuse. When they gathered, she would say: "You know what happened, and I have given birth. He is your son, O so-and-so," naming whomever she wished among them. Her child would then be attributed to him, and the man could not refuse.</li>
                <li><strong>Nikah al-Badal (نكاح البدل - Wife Swapping):</strong> This is when a man would say to another man: "Give up your wife to me, and I will give up my wife to you," and they would exchange wives. This is one of the ugliest forms of violating honor and confusing lineage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These types of "marriage," and others, indicate the extent of sexual chaos that prevailed in pre-Islamic society, and the absence of moral and legal controls governing relations between men and women.</p>
            <h6>Female Infanticide (وأد البنات - Wa'd al-Banat - The Crime of Killing Innocence Due to Shame or Poverty)</h6>
            <p>The custom of female infanticide (وأد البنات) is considered one of the most heinous crimes known to humanity. This custom was widespread in some Arab tribes before Islam. If a man was given the news of the birth of a daughter, his face would darken, and his heart would fill with anxiety and grief. He saw the birth of a daughter as a shame and a deficiency. Some would bury their daughters alive, either for fear of the shame she might bring upon her family if she grew up and was captured or taken prisoner, or for fear of poverty and inability to provide for her. The Quran depicted this miserable psychological state experienced by some pre-Islamic fathers:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief. He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the dust? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide." (Quran, An-Nahl النحل: 58-59)</blockquote>
            <p>Islam came to eradicate this barbaric custom, to honor women, and to elevate their status. Allah Almighty threatened those who commit this crime with severe punishment, saying:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked, For what sin was she killed?" (Quran, At-Takwir التكوير: 8-9)</blockquote>
            <h6>Killing Children for Fear of Poverty (الفقر والخوف من المستقبل - Poverty and Fear of the Future)</h6>
            <p>The crime of killing children was not limited to girls. Some Arabs would kill their children, whether male or female, for fear of poverty and inability to provide them with a livelihood. This reflects the extent of despair and despondency that controlled some souls, and lack of trust in Allah's provision and power. Islam forbade this crime and affirmed that Allah Almighty is the Provider, the Possessor of Power, the Strong, and that He has undertaken to provide for all creatures. Allah Almighty said:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"And do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them." (Quran, Al-An'am الأنعام: 151)</blockquote>
            <p>And He also said:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin." (Quran, Al-Isra' الإسراء: 31)</blockquote>
            <h6>Contempt for Women and Denial of Their Basic Rights (A Demeaning View)</h6>
            <p>Women in pre-Islamic society suffered from a demeaning view and did not enjoy many of the rights that Islam granted them. They were considered inferior to men, and their opinions were often unheard.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deprivation of Inheritance:</strong> Women were mostly deprived of inheritance, which was usually restricted to men capable of bearing arms and defending the tribe.</li>
                <li><strong>Marriage and Divorce Without Controls:</strong> A man could marry as many women as he wished without a maximum limit, and divorce them whenever he wished without a valid reason, and without any rights accruing to the divorced woman.</li>
                <li><strong>Dhihar (الظهار) and Ila' (الإيلاء):</strong> There were unjust customs concerning women, such as Dhihar (الظهار - when a man says to his wife, "You are to me like my mother's back," making her forbidden to him without being divorced), and Ila' (الإيلاء - when a man swears not to approach his wife for a certain period, leaving her in limbo, neither a wife nor divorced).</li>
                <li><strong>Inheriting Women Like Property:</strong> It was a custom among some Arabs that if a man died, his eldest son would inherit his father's wife (other than his own mother) just as he inherited the rest of his property. He could marry her if he wished, marry her off to whomever he wished and take her dowry, or prevent her from marrying (عضلها - <span class="arabic-term">'adalaha</span>) until she died so he could inherit her. Islam forbade this heinous custom, saying:
                    <blockquote class="quran-verse">"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion." (Quran, An-Nisa' النساء: 19)</blockquote>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Islam came to honor women, restore their usurped rights, and make them sisters to men in humanity and responsibility.</p>
            <h6>Tabarruj (التبرج - Ostentatious Display) and Showing Off Adornments (Absence of Modesty and Chastity)</h6>
            <p>Tabarruj (التبرج), which is a woman displaying her adornments and charms before non-mahram (أجانب - unrelated) men, was a common phenomenon in pre-Islamic society. The Quran described this as "تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ" (<span class="arabic-term">tabarruj al-jahiliyyati al-oola</span> - the display of the former times of ignorance) (Quran, Al-Ahzab الأحزاب: 33). Tabarruj was not limited to uncovering hair or face but included showing the chest, neck, arms, and legs, and wearing tight or transparent clothes that described the body's charms. Women would also perfume themselves, walk ostentatiously, and strike their feet to make known what they concealed of their adornment. Islam came to command women to wear Hijab (الحجاب - veil), to be modest and chaste, urged them to adhere to shyness (الحياء - <span class="arabic-term">al-Haya'</span>), and forbade them from Tabarruj and displaying their adornments except to whom Allah permitted. Allah Almighty said:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." (Quran, Al-Ahzab الأحزاب: 59)</blockquote>
            <p>And He also said:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"...and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed." (Quran, An-Nur النور: 31)</blockquote>
            <h6>Detestable Tribalism (العصبية القبلية المقيتة - al-'Asabiyyah al-Qabaliyyah al-Maqeetah) (Source of Conflicts and Wars)</h6>
            <p>Tribalism was the prevailing law in pre-Islamic society. An individual belonged to his tribe with absolute loyalty, was fanatically devoted to it, and supported it whether right or wrong. The tribe was the unit of social and political solidarity, and the individual derived his strength and protection from his tribe. This tribalism was a source of many conflicts and wars between tribes, where the slightest reasons were enough to ignite a war that could last for many years, shedding blood and taking lives. Islam came to eradicate this detestable tribalism and to make the bond of faith the supreme bond that unites people. Allah Almighty said:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"The believers are but brothers." (Quran, Al-Hujurat الحجرات: 10)</blockquote>
            <p>And the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) said:</p>
            <blockquote class="hadith-text">"He is not one of us who calls to tribalism, he is not one of us who fights for tribalism, and he is not one of us who dies for tribalism." (Narrated by Abu Dawud, classed as Hasan by Al-Albani)</blockquote>
            <h6>Plundering, Looting, Raids, and Continuous Wars (Lack of Security and Stability)</h6>
            <p>Wars and raids between Arab tribes were an integral part of their daily lives. Strong tribes would raid weaker tribes, plunder their wealth, and capture their women and children. There was no law or central authority to deter aggressors or protect the weak. These wars often arose for trivial reasons, such as disputes over a water well, a pasture, or an old vendetta. They would last for many years, leaving behind devastation and destruction. Among the most famous of these wars was the War of Basus (حرب البسوس) between the tribes of Bakr (بكر) and Taghlib (تغلب), which lasted for forty years over a she-camel. The War of Dahis and Ghabra (حرب داحس والغبراء) between the tribes of 'Abs (عبس) and Dhubyan (ذبيان) also lasted for decades. The War of Bu'ath (حرب بعاث) between the tribes of Aws (الأوس) and Khazraj (الخزرج) in Yathrib (يثرب) weakened them and made them more receptive to the call of Islam when it came. This situation of insecurity and instability had negative effects on economic and social life, making people live in a state of constant fear and anxiety.</p>
            <h5>Ethical Virtues and Noble Values (A Glimmer of Light in the Overwhelming Darkness)</h5>
            <p>Despite all these vices and deviations prevalent in pre-Islamic society, it was not entirely devoid of some noble values and ethical virtues. These values were like a glimmer of light in this overwhelming darkness, indicating that the sound human فطرة (<span class="arabic-term">fitrah</span>) had not completely died, and that remnants of the religion of Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him) were still alive in some souls. Islam came to affirm and praise these virtues, to perfect and refine them, and to make them part of its integrated ethical system. Among the most prominent of these virtues were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Truthfulness in Speech and Fulfilling Promises (Authentic Values):</strong> The Arabs, despite their ignorance and misguidance, prided themselves on truthfulness in speech and considered lying a defect and a disgrace. They fulfilled their promises and adhered to their covenants, even if it cost them dearly. This noble trait was manifested in many situations, even with their enemies. When Heraclius (هرقل - Hiraql), the Byzantine emperor, asked Abu Sufyan ibn Harb (أبو سفيان بن حرب - May Allah be pleased with him) (who was still a polytheist at the time) about the characteristics of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), Abu Sufyan could not lie to him but described the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) truthfully and honestly, even though he was one of his staunchest enemies. Abu Sufyan later said: "By Allah, had it not been for the shame of being accused of lying, I would have lied about him." This shows that the value of truthfulness was deeply rooted in their souls. Similarly, fulfilling covenants was one of their most prominent traits. If an Arab gave a pledge or security, he would adhere to it, even at the cost of his own life. They despised those who broke their covenants or betrayed their trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Generosity, Munificence, and Honoring Guests (Manifestations of Arab Nobility):</strong> Arabs were famous for generosity (الكرم - <span class="arabic-term">al-Karam</span>) and munificence (الجود - <span class="arabic-term">al-Jood</span>). They competed in honoring and feeding guests, considering it one of the noble morals and a cause for pride and praise. They would spend all they owned for this purpose, even if it led them to poverty and need. Many examples of this overflowing generosity are found in their poetry and stories. One of the most famous generous men in Jahiliyyah (الجاهلية) was Hatim al-Ta'i (حاتم الطائي), whose generosity became proverbial.</li>
                <li><strong>Respecting and Protecting Neighbors (A Sacred Right):</strong> The neighbor (الجار - <span class="arabic-term">al-Jar</span>) held a sacred status among the Arabs. They protected their neighbors, defended them, and did not tolerate injustice or harm to them. They considered aggression against a neighbor one of the greatest crimes and ugliest flaws. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) entered Mecca after returning from his journey to Ta'if (الطائف), where he had suffered severe harm from its people, under the protection (جوار - <span class="arabic-term">jiwar</span>) of Al-Mut'im ibn 'Adi (المطعم بن عدي), who was a polytheist. Al-Mut'im protected the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), ordered his sons to arm themselves and stand at the corners of the Kaaba, and announced that he had granted protection to Muhammad (محمد). Thus, none of Quraysh (قريش) could harm him. This shows the extent of their respect for the right of neighborliness.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience, Patience, Courage, and Offering Aid (Qualities of the Arab Knight):</strong> The harsh desert life, with its challenges and dangers, endowed them with qualities of resilience (الجلد - <span class="arabic-term">al-Jalad</span>), patience (الصبر - <span class="arabic-term">as-Sabr</span>), courage (الشجاعة - <span class="arabic-term">ash-Shaja'ah</span>), and اقدام (<span class="arabic-term">iqdam</span> - valor). They faced difficulties bravely, endured hardships patiently, and did not fear death in defending their tribe or honor. They would aid the oppressed (النجدة - <span class="arabic-term">an-Najdah</span>) and stand by them, even if they were not from their tribe. This is evident in the Hilf al-Fudul (حلف الفضول - Alliance of the Virtuous), in which some Quraysh (قريش) tribes pledged to be united with the oppressed against the oppressor until his right was restored. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) witnessed it before his mission and praised it after, saying: "I witnessed in the house of 'Abdullah ibn Jud'an (عبد الله بن جدعان) an alliance which I would not exchange for red camels, and if I were called to it in Islam, I would respond." This indicates that this noble value existed among them, and Islam came to affirm and strengthen it.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect and Veneration for the Sacred House (البيت الحرام) (Remnants of Hanifiyyah - الحنيفية):</strong> Despite the spread of polytheism and idol worship, the Arabs still venerated the Sacred House (البيت الحرام - al-Bayt al-Haram) and respected it immensely. They considered it the House of Allah, performed Hajj (الحج) to it, circumambulated it (الطواف - <span class="arabic-term">at-Tawaf</span>), and performed some rituals inherited from their father Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him). They forbade fighting in the Sacred Months (الأشهر الحرم - al-Ash-hur al-Hurum) (Dhu al-Qa'dah ذو القعدة, Dhu al-Hijjah ذو الحجة, Muharram محرم, and Rajab رجب), considering it part of their religious observances. They would not raise arms in the Haram (الحرم - Sacred Precinct), nor kill game in it, nor cut trees in it. Even if a man met his father's killer in the Haram, he would not harm him, out of respect for the sanctity of the place.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Remnants of Abrahamic Religious Rituals (Traces of a Glorious Past)</h6>
            <p>The Arabs preserved some religious rituals inherited from their father Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him), which represented remnants of the tolerant Hanifiyyah (الحنيفية). Among these rituals were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prohibition of marrying certain close relatives, such as mothers, daughters, sisters, paternal aunts, and maternal aunts.</li>
                <li>Ritual bathing after sexual impurity (الاغتسال من الجنابة - <span class="arabic-term">al-Ghusl min al-Janabah</span>).</li>
                <li>Circumcision (الختان - <span class="arabic-term">al-Khitan</span>) for males and females, although it was marred by some incorrect practices.</li>
                <li>Some practices of fitrah (الفطرة - natural disposition) such as trimming nails, shaving pubic hair, plucking armpit hair, letting the beard grow, and using the Siwak (السواك - tooth-stick).</li>
                <li>Hajj (الحج) and 'Umrah (العمرة) to the Sacred House, although they had introduced many innovations (البدع - <span class="arabic-term">al-Bida'</span>) and polytheistic practices (الشركيات - <span class="arabic-term">ash-Shirkiyyat</span>) into them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Alongside these rituals, there were individuals in the Arabian Peninsula known as "الحنفاء" (<span class="arabic-term">al-Hunafa'</span>), who remained on something of the religion of Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him). They worshipped Allah alone, rejected idol worship, and did not follow Judaism or Christianity in their distorted forms. Among them were Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn Nufayl (زيد بن عمرو بن نفيل), Umayyah ibn Abi as-Salt (أمية بن أبي الصلت) (at one stage of his life), Waraqah ibn Nawfal (ورقة بن نوفل) (who had extensive knowledge of the books of the People of the Book before converting to Christianity), and Quss ibn Sa'idah al-Iyadi (قس بن ساعدة الإيادي), and others who were seeking the path of truth. All these were remnants of the religion of Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him). Islam came to purify them of impurities, restore them to their pure origin, and make them part of its complete and eternal law.</p>

            <h4>Third: Other Religions Prevalent Before Islam and Their Influence (A Comparative and Analytical View)</h4>
            <p>Paganism was not the only belief system adhered to by the people of the Arabian Peninsula and its neighboring regions. There were other religions, both heavenly and non-heavenly, with varying degrees of influence and prevalence. Studying these religions helps us understand the complex religious map that Islam faced at the beginning of its call, and how it dealt with the followers of these religions.</p>
            <h5>Christianity (النصرانية - an-Nasraniyyah) and its Limited Spread (Between Authenticity and Deviation)</h5>
            <p>Christianity, brought by Christ Jesus son of Mary (المسيح عيسى ابن مريم - al-Masih 'Isa ibn Maryam, peace be upon him), had spread in some areas surrounding the Arabian Peninsula, such as the Levant (بلاد الشام), Egypt (مصر), and Abyssinia (الحبشة). It also had a limited presence in some parts of the Arabian Peninsula itself, especially in Najran (نجران) in Yemen, where a large and strong Christian community existed. Christianity, in its origin, was a monotheistic heavenly religion, calling for the worship of Allah alone and affirming the message of Christ (peace be upon him) as one of Allah's prophets. However, over time, Christianity was subjected to much distortion and alteration, and pagan beliefs alien to the original teachings of Christ entered it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Doctrine of the Trinity (الابتعاد عن جوهر التوحيد - Departure from the Essence of Monotheism):</strong> One of the most prominent deviations that occurred in Christianity was the doctrine of the Trinity (التثليث - <span class="arabic-term">at-Tathleeth</span>), which states that God is three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). This is a doctrine that contradicts the essence of monotheism (التوحيد - <span class="arabic-term">at-Tawhid</span>) to which all heavenly messages called. The Quran strongly condemned this doctrine, saying:
                    <blockquote class="quran-verse">"They have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the third of three.' And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment." (Quran, Al-Ma'idah المائدة: 73)</blockquote>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Deification of Christ and His Mother (الغلو في الأنبياء والصالحين - Exaggeration Regarding Prophets and Righteous People):</strong> Christians also exaggerated in their veneration of Christ (peace be upon him) and his mother, Mary the Virgin (مريم العذراء - Maryam al-'Adhra'), elevating them from the rank of humanity to the rank of divinity or semi-divinity. The Quran warned against this exaggeration, saying:
                    <blockquote class="quran-verse">"O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three'; desist – it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son." (Quran, An-Nisa' النساء: 171)</blockquote>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Worship of Saints, Images, and Statues (مظاهر وثنية - Pagan Manifestations):</strong> The worship of saints, and the use of their images and statues in churches, and seeking closeness to them through supplication and vows, also spread among Christians. This is one of the manifestations of paganism that infiltrated Christianity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) was sent, Christianity in Najran (نجران) and elsewhere had deviated far from its original truth and had become a mixture of heavenly teachings and pagan beliefs. The Christians of Najran came as a delegation to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) in Medina (المدينة) and debated with him about Christ. Allah then revealed verses from Surah Al 'Imran (سورة آل عمران) concerning them and called them to Mubahalah (المباهلة - mutual cursing), but they declined.</p>
            <h5>Judaism (اليهودية - al-Yahudiyyah) and its Transformation into a Closed Religion (Between Expectation and Obstinacy)</h5>
            <p>Judaism, which Allah revealed to Moses (موسى - peace be upon him), was a great heavenly religion, carrying a law and guidance for the Children of Israel (بني إسرائيل - Bani Isra'il). However, the Jews, over the ages, were subjected to many trials and tribulations, and their religion was subjected to distortion and alteration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geographical Spread of the Jews:</strong> Judaism was not widespread in the heart of the Arabian Peninsula but was concentrated in areas like Yemen (اليمن) and the Levant (بلاد الشام). However, after the severe events that befell the Jews, especially the destruction of their Temple in Jerusalem twice (once by Nebuchadnezzar (نبوخذ نصر) the Babylonian in 586 BC, and again by the Romans in 70 AD), many of them migrated and dispersed to various parts of the world, in what is known as the "Jewish Diaspora" (الشتات اليهودي - <span class="arabic-term">ash-Shatat al-Yahudi</span>). A large number of these Jewish immigrants settled in some fertile oases in the north of the Arabian Peninsula, such as Yathrib (يثرب - Medina المنورة), Khaybar (خيبر), Fadak (فدك), and Tayma' (تيماء). They worked in agriculture, trade, and some handicrafts.</li>
                <li><strong>Awaiting the Last Prophet (بشارة وتحريف - Good Tidings and Distortion):</strong> The Jews, as mentioned in their books, were awaiting the advent of a final prophet. Many of them hoped or expected him to be from among the Children of Israel to restore their glory and dominion. They used to seek victory (يستفتحون - <span class="arabic-term">yastaftihun</span>) through the advent of this prophet against their polytheistic Arab enemies. The Quran referred to this expectation in His saying:
                    <blockquote class="quran-verse">"And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them – although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved – but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers." (Quran, Al-Baqarah البقرة: 89)</blockquote>
                    However, when Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) was sent from among the Arabs, and not from the Children of Israel, most of them disbelieved in him out of envy, obstinacy, and arrogance, even though they recognized him as they recognized their own sons, due to the descriptions of him they found in their books.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Distortion of the Torah and Departure from the Essence of Religion:</strong> One of the most prominent deviations of the Jews was their distortion of their holy book, the Torah (التوراة), and their alteration of Allah's words. The Quran referred to this distortion in several places, saying:
                    <blockquote class="quran-verse">"Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?" (Quran, Al-Baqarah البقرة: 75)</blockquote>
                    The Jews also departed from the essence of religion, focused on appearances and superficialities, became fanatical about their race and nationality, considered themselves God's chosen people, and believed other nations were inferior to them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Zoroastrianism (المجوسية - al-Majusiyyah) (Fire Worship in Persia - بلاد فارس)</h5>
            <p>Zoroastrianism was the official religion of the Sasanian Persian Empire (الإمبراطورية الفارسية الساسانية), which controlled vast territories adjacent to the Arabian Peninsula. Zoroastrianism is based on the worship of fire, considering it a symbol of God or one of His manifestations. Zoroastrians also believe in the existence of two conflicting deities: the god of good (Ahura Mazda - أهورامزدا) and the god of evil (Ahriman - أهريمان). Zoroastrianism had a limited influence on some Arab tribes neighboring Persia but did not spread widely in the heart of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
            <h5>Sabaeans (الصابئة - as-Sabi'ah) (Worship of Planets and Stars)</h5>
            <p>The Sabaeans were a religious group that worshipped planets and stars, believing they had an influence on people's lives and destinies. They had a presence in some regions of Iraq (العراق) and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
            <h5>Dahriyyun (الدهريون - Materialists/Atheists) (Denial of the Creator and Resurrection)</h5>
            <p>There was a group of people, known as Dahriyyun (الدهريون) or Zindiqs (الزنادقة - heretics), who denied the existence of the Creator. They believed that the world was ancient and eternal, and that there was no resurrection or reckoning after death. The Quran referred to their saying:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"And they say, 'There is not but our worldly life; we die and live, and nothing destroys us except time.' And they have of that no knowledge; they are only assuming." (Quran, Al-Jathiyah الجاثية: 24)</blockquote>

            <h4>Fourth: The Spread of Polytheism (الشرك - ash-Shirk) and the Alteration of the Religion of Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him) (Roots of the Doctrinal Crisis)</h4>
            <p>The Arabs, as we mentioned earlier, were originally on the religion of their father Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him), which is the religion of pure monotheism (التوحيد الخالص - <span class="arabic-term">at-Tawhid al-Khalis</span>), based on worshipping Allah alone without any partner, and rejecting all forms of polytheism and paganism. However, with the passage of time and the distance from that era, polytheism gradually crept into their beliefs until it became the dominant religion in most parts of the Arabian Peninsula at the dawn of Islam.</p>
            <h5>'Amr ibn Luhayy al-Khuza'i (عمرو بن لُحَيّ الخُزاعي) (The Pioneer of Paganism in the Arabian Peninsula)</h5>
            <p>Historical sources agree that the first person to introduce idol worship into the Arabian Peninsula and change the religion of Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him) was a man named 'Amr ibn Luhayy al-Khuza'i (عمرو بن لحي الخزاعي). 'Amr ibn Luhayy was an obeyed master among his people and enjoyed a prestigious position among the Arabs. He traveled on one of his journeys to the Levant (بلاد الشام), where he saw its people worshipping idols, seeking closeness to them, and believing that they interceded for them with Allah. He approved of this matter, and Satan made this heinous act seem attractive to him. He returned to Mecca (مكة) with some idols, set them up around the Kaaba (الكعبة), and called people to worship them and seek closeness to them. The first major idol he brought was "Hubal" (هُبَل), which became one of the most famous and greatest idols of Quraysh (قريش). Then, idols proliferated, and their worship spread among various Arab tribes, and every tribe had its own idol that it worshipped and sought closeness to. It is said that jinn (الجن) guided 'Amr ibn Luhayy (عمرو بن لحي) to the locations of the idols of the people of Noah (نوح - peace be upon him) (Wadd ود, Suwa' سواع, Yaghuth يغوث, Ya'uq يعوق, and Nasr نسر), which were buried in the Jeddah (جدة) area after the flood. He unearthed them and distributed them among the Arab tribes. Thus, the Arabian Peninsula, which was a beacon of monotheism, turned into a hotbed of polytheism and paganism.</p>
            <h5>The Spread and Multiplicity of Idols (مظاهر الشرك - Manifestations of Polytheism)</h5>
            <p>Idol worship was not limited to a few idols; rather, idols multiplied and diversified, and every tribe, and sometimes every household, had its own idol. These idols were made of stone, wood, or even dates. They believed that these idols brought them closer to Allah and interceded for them with Him. The Quran mentioned the names of some of these idols, saying:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"So have you considered al-Lat (اللَّاتَ) and al-'Uzza (الْعُزَّىٰ)? And Manat (وَمَنَاةَ), the other, the third?" (Quran, An-Najm النجم: 19-20)</blockquote>
            <p>Al-Lat (اللات) was a white inscribed rock in Ta'if (الطائف), worshipped by Thaqif (ثقيف). Al-'Uzza (العزى) was a tree in Nakhlah (نخلة), worshipped by Quraysh (قريش) and Kinanah (كنانة). Manat (مناة) was a rock at al-Mushallal (المشلل) near Qudayd (قديد), worshipped by the Aws (الأوس) and Khazraj (الخزرج). The number of idols around the Kaaba (الكعبة) at the time of the conquest of Mecca (فتح مكة) was three hundred and sixty, which indicates the extent to which polytheism and idol worship had spread in that era.</p>
            <h5>Altering the Rituals of Abraham's Religion (تحريف الحنيفية - Distortion of Hanifiyyah)</h5>
            <p>'Amr ibn Luhayy (عمرو بن لحي) did not stop at spreading idol worship but also changed some of the rituals that remained from the religion of Abraham (إبراهيم - peace be upon him). He innovated matters concerning livestock, forbade what Allah had permitted, and permitted what Allah had forbidden.</p>
            <h6>Al-Bahirah (البحيرة), As-Sa'ibah (السائبة), Al-Wasilah (الوصيلة), and Al-Hami (الحامي) (Innovations Concerning Livestock)</h6>
            <p>Among the most prominent of these innovations was what he innovated concerning livestock, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Al-Bahirah (البحيرة):</strong> A she-camel whose ear was slit if she gave birth to a certain number of offspring (usually five, the last being male), then she was left alone, not ridden, her milk not drunk, and she was dedicated to idols.</li>
                <li><strong>As-Sa'ibah (السائبة):</strong> A she-camel let loose for a vow, for a sick person's recovery, or for other reasons. She was not to be utilized and was left to graze wherever she wished.</li>
                <li><strong>Al-Wasilah (الوصيلة):</strong> A ewe that gave birth to a female after a female (seven consecutive female births without a male in between). Her sister was joined to her (i.e., also dedicated), and she was not slaughtered; it was said, "She has joined her sister."</li>
                <li><strong>Al-Hami (الحامي):</strong> A male camel that had sired a certain number of females (usually ten). His back was protected; he was not ridden or burdened, and he was left for the idols.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Quran condemned these pre-Islamic innovations and considered them fabrications against Allah, saying:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"Allah has not appointed [such innovations as] Bahirah or Sa'ibah or Wasilah or Hami. But those who disbelieve invent falsehood about Allah, and most of them do not reason." (Quran, Al-Ma'idah المائدة: 103)</blockquote>
            <h6>An-Nasi' (النسيء) (Tampering with the Sacred Months)</h6>
            <p>Another of their innovations was An-Nasi' (النسيء), which was postponing the sanctity of the month of Muharram (محرم) to the month of Safar (صفر), or advancing it, according to their whims and interests. If they wanted to fight in Muharram, which is one of the sacred months, they would declare it permissible and make another month sacred in its place. The Quran condemned this practice and considered it an increase in disbelief, saying:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"Indeed, the postponing [of restriction within sacred months] is an increase in disbelief by which those who have disbelieved are led astray. They make it lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by Allah and [thereby] make lawful what Allah has made unlawful. Made pleasing to them is the evil of their deeds. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people." (Quran, At-Tawbah التوبة: 37)</blockquote>
            <p>The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) delivered a sermon during the Farewell Pilgrimage (حجة الوداع - Hajjat al-Wada') and announced that time had returned to its original state as Allah created it on the day He created the heavens and the earth, and he abolished the custom of An-Nasi' (النسيء).</p>
            <h6>Circumambulating the House Naked (انتهاك لقدسية الحرم - Violation of the Sanctity of the Haram)</h6>
            <p>One of the customs of the people of Mecca (مكة) (the الحُمْس - <span class="arabic-term">al-Hums</span>) was that they would prevent those who came for Hajj (الحج) or 'Umrah (العمرة) from outside Mecca from circumambulating the House in the clothes they came in, under the pretext that these were clothes in which they had disobeyed Allah. So, they would oblige them either to borrow clothes from the people of Mecca, buy new clothes from them, or circumambulate the House naked. Men would circumambulate naked, and women would circumambulate naked except for a small piece of cloth covering their private parts. This shows the extent of ignorance and misguidance these people had reached, as they violated the sanctity of the Sacred House with these heinous practices. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) forbade this custom and ordered that no one should circumambulate the House naked after the year of the Hajj led by Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (أبو بكر الصديق - May Allah be pleased with him) (the ninth year of Hijrah).</p>
            <h6>Al-Istiqsam bil-Azlam (الاستقسام بالأزلام) (Divination and Seeking Knowledge of the Unseen)</h6>
            <p>Another of their customs was Al-Istiqsam bil-Azlam (الاستقسام بالأزلام - divining by arrows). These were three featherless arrows; on one was written "Do," on the second "Do not do," and the third was blank. If one of them wanted to undertake an important matter, such as travel, marriage, or trade, he would go to the custodian (سادن - <span class="arabic-term">sadin</span>) of the Kaaba (الكعبة), give him a gift, and then ask him to draw the arrows for him. The custodian would draw an arrow. If "Do" came out, he would proceed with the matter. If "Do not do" came out, he would refrain. If the blank arrow came out, he would repeat the draw. This is a type of soothsaying and seeking knowledge of the unseen from other than Allah. Islam forbade it and considered it the work of Satan. Allah Almighty said:</p>
            <blockquote class="quran-verse">"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful." (Quran, Al-Ma'idah المائدة: 90)</blockquote>
            <p>Islam prescribed instead the Istikharah prayer (صلاة الاستخارة), where a Muslim prays two rak'ahs and then supplicates to Allah Almighty to choose what is best for him.</p>
            <h5>Summary of the Religious and Doctrinal Situation</h5>
            <p>The religious and doctrinal situation in the Arabian Peninsula before Islam was characterized by polytheism, paganism, ignorance, and misguidance. Despite the presence of remnants of the tolerant Hanifiyyah (الحنيفية), they had been obscured by the innovations and deviations introduced by 'Amr ibn Luhayy (عمرو بن لحي) and others. Minds were captive to superstitions and illusions, and hearts were attached to other than Allah. There was an urgent need for a new heavenly message to return people to the innate disposition of monotheism (فطرة التوحيد - <span class="arabic-term">fitrat at-Tawhid</span>) and to bring them out of the worship of created beings to the worship of the Lord of created beings.</p>

            <h3>Preparing for the Transition to the Dawn of Prophethood</h3>
            <p>O brothers and sisters, after this detailed review of the conditions of the world, especially the Arabian Peninsula, before the mission of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), it becomes clear to us the extent of the darkness that enveloped the corners of the earth. Humanity was living in utter ignorance (جاهلية جهلاء - <span class="arabic-term">jahiliyyah jahlaa'</span>), blind misguidance (ضلالة عمياء - <span class="arabic-term">dalalah 'amyaa'</span>), and deviation from the straight path of Allah.</p>
            <p>But Allah Almighty, in His mercy and wisdom, did not leave His servants in vain. In the midst of this overwhelming darkness, Allah Almighty permitted the sun of prophethood to rise and the light of guidance to dawn. So, He sent His servant and messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), as a mercy to the worlds, a savior for humanity, and a guide to the truth and to a straight path.</p>
            <p>In the upcoming sessions, by the will of Allah Almighty, we will trace the course of this blessed mission, from the moment revelation descended upon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH) in the cave of Hira' (غار حراء), through the various stages of the call, the challenges it faced, and the victories it achieved, until Allah Almighty established the state of Islam and spread His religion throughout the lands.</p>
            <p>We ask Allah Almighty to make us among those who follow the Sunnah (سنة - way) of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم - PBUH), who walk on his path, and who trace his footsteps. And to grant us understanding of his Seerah (سيرة), and to act upon the guidance and light it contains. He is the Master of that and Capable of it.</p>
            <p>Until our next meeting, by the will of Allah, we entrust you to Allah, whose trusts are never lost. And peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah, and His blessings. (والسلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته - Wa assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh).</p>
